## Demo-centric Planning

Our app hopes to address the problem finding times that work for everybody in the group. Every individual has busy schedules and many important responsibilities. Coordinating these schedules can be a real pain!

Group Planner hopes make that planning and coordinating process smoother. By utilizing the Google Calendar API, we are able to pull an individual's calendar events seemlessly. After, you can easily create groups with your friends and Group Planner will display every individual's events on top of each other on one single, clean calendar page. This allows users to quickly see when they can meet up based on availability. 

Imagine a small group of college student software developers working on an iOS project. They live busy, busy lives: work, college classes (especially their CS ones!), extracurriculars such as clubs, and much much more. One team member will have class when the other has free time when another has work. How can the developers coordinate so that they can get this project done? Enter Group Planner. The developers quickly create a group with their Google accounts and use the application to sync their busy schedules. Being able to easily see when they all have free time, they set up a weekly meeting and coding sessions to be able to successfully complete their project!
