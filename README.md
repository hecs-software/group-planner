## Demo-centric Planning

Our app hopes to address the problem big gatherings of friends face. It is always a pain to think about what to do and where to go. Worst of all, if every friend says "I don't care! I'm down with anything!", then not a single decision gets made.

Our app allows each individual collaborate in the decision making process through Hangouts. They can input different preferences depending on the Hangout. By keeping track of everybody's preferences, whether they be food, movie, or music genres, our app will be able to give suggestions that pleases the most people in the Hangout!

Imagine a group of 6 friends meeting up for dinner after a long week of midterms and studying. They've been stressed and just want to relax with some good company and food. One friend really wants to grab Mexican food. Another adamantly wants Sushi. Another exclaims that "We ALWAYS get Mexican and sushi! Can't we try something else?" Finally, one of the friends pulls out their phone and opens up the Group Planner. She quickly and easily creates a Hangout and adds the 5 other friends. They each pull out their phones, join the Hangout, and all 6 begin putting in their preferences on what they want to eat. Once each friend has finalized their preferences, Group Planner presents a list of suggestions, with the top suggestion most likely to please the majority of the group. The group of 6 friends smile each other and get excited over the restaurant suggested at the top! They head out the door for a night of catching up, delicious food, and, most importantly, spending time with each other.
